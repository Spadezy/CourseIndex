        <p> 1. From what I understand and think, Lialina's definition of the universal user is pretty clear and accurate. Lialina describes universal users as people who are being independent and doing things in their own way.  The definition helps make Schwulst's argument for individual websites much stronger over platforms. Many platforms in the present day don't have much security, which is why many people cannot trust many online sources to do their actions. However, I also like to see universal users as just normal ordinary users because of how the vast internet is actually divided. By this I mean, many categories have their own websites for their different users.

        <p2>For example, there are websites for music like Spotify, there are websites for shopping like Amazon, or there are websites to display images like Instagram and other social media platforms. There are many websites for all kinds of things, although to do many of these things at once, you'd need to have all these websites open up at the same time. Schwulst mentions the ideas of a personal website, where you can do all the things you want, on one singular website instead of having many things open. Having anything open on one website in your organized fashion makes things much easier and simpler. On top of that, personal websites have much better security in comparison of having 3 public websites open at the same time.

        <p3> 2. I think of myself as a "user". I am now 20 years old, and I have been using the internet for as long as I can remember. It's always been there for me, something I sometimes want to leave however can't ever really escape. The internet is just apart of my life at this point, almost like an essential need. There is many good and bad things that can come out of being a daily user of the internet. Liliana says: "All these designs that demand attention, and ask for forgiveness and engagement formed us as users, and we are always adjusting, improvising and at the same time taking control.‚Äù Thinking about this quote, it makes it feel as if the internet is a shadow always with us, which changes with us and us changing with the internet. Over time it slowly takes apart of who we are, and starts to control our actions.</p3>
