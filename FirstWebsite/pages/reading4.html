                        1. Surveillance can have many meanings depending on how you use it. However, I personally feel, it means looking over someone or something and keeping an analysis upon them. In Steyerl's essay, he talks about the history of many point of views and how that thinking has evolved over time, then going to the technology has evolved enough to show a whole perspective of out planet.  Surveillance also feels like one is being watched and been kept an eye on. In modern time, everyone has atleast thought once in their lives that they are being watched by someone, as the feeling of surveillance has almost been normalized. We have so much technology keeping an eye on everything (cameras, drones, satellites, etc.) that almost everything we do is being monitored and used as data research. 
                        <br> Aerial data collection is helpful, and many are comfortable with it. Yet, when you really dive deep into it, it's really scary to think about. Almost everything you have done in your life has been collected as data, from the moment you were born. Yes, in a way it's to keep many safe and evolve as mankind but it just breaks all thought of regular thinking as if your a guinea pig in a cage. 
                        <br>One quote I would like to share from Steyerl's essay, basically tells what I would like to say: "new technologies have enabled the detached observant gaze to become ever more inclusive and all-knowing to the point of becoming massively intrusiveâ€”as militaristic as it is pornographic, as intense as extensive, both micro- and macroscopic".
