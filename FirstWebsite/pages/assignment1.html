                    <h1> Initial Process:</h1>
                    <p>
                        For my initial process, I really didn't know how to start so I started with brainstorming some
                        ideas just to get an idea on how to go along with it. After some time, I had a decent idea on what
                        I wanted to accomplish in this project. It was to find a good way to show my computer screen
                        time during covid and design it for my work. Right under, is my notes that I took to brainstorm, it
                        also has some very rough sketches.I didn’t have much process, as I knew my idea on what to do and how to accomplish it. I wasn’t
                        able to really get feedback due to how busy I have been, other than some of my peers who
                        were kind enough to help me out. </p>
                    <h2> My First Draft:</h2>
                    <p2>
                        My first draft is really similar to how my end result actually looks like. My idea was to convey and
                        portray my time on the computer during covid. Most of it was spent playing video games, with
                        also some work and other things on the side. I decided to create a calendar-like design for
                        keeping track of my time on the computer. However, we were tasked to create this without the
                        use of any design software. The only software that came to mind was excel, and from there I
                        had started my assignment 1.
                    </p2>
                    <h3> My Final Project:</h3>
                    <p3>
                        I didn’t have much change from my first draft to my final as I thought there was only so much I
                        could do in a new software that I wasn’t familiar with. My theme revolved a little more around
                        video games or games in general, as that was a big part of my quarantine life. I decided to
                        create the layout in a way that it looks like it’s a computer screen with some type of controllers at
                        the bottom referencing the video games. However, it’s also made in a way to show it like a
                        board game, like chess or an old game like “go”. This was to reference a general game and also
                        how the computer kinda conquered my time during quarantine, showing how much was
                        covered.
