                    1. I think many people have thought of this, however one pattern in nature that I see as being programmatic is the pattern of a honeycomb. Honeycomb, also known as the structure/layout of the beehive, has a unique pattern of hexagons laid around each other (no spaces between the hexagons). Honeycomb has never had a pattern of any other shape before, like there is no honeycomb in the world that is made of squares, circles, etc. This is my reason into believing that the honeycomb pattern is programmatic pattern in nature, it has no variations of the pattern, it is always the same hexagonal honeycomb.
                    <br><br> Being programmatic has many characteristics as well, for example, the pattern of the honeycomb has a very repetitive and identical pattern showing that it's more programmatic.  The reason bees choose this shape in the first place is because of the efficient use of space. Bees are creatures that have a goal to store, store their honey.
                    Hexagons can hold the maximum amount of honey, with no space at all being wasted. This is because of how the hexagonal pattern works. Bees are programmed to always use the same shape for their hives for this purpose as it's best and most efficient way, which in thus results in programmatic pattern of the honeycomb.
